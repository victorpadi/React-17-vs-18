# React-17-vs-18
Decoding React: Exploring the Evolution from 17 to 18
Here is a comparison of React V17 and React V18:

Feature

                                React 17               React 18

Concurrent Rendering

                                   No                     Yes

Automatic Batching

                                   No                     Yes

New Event Delegation Model

                                   No                     Yes

New Context API

                                   No                     Yes

Experimental Suspense Hook

                                   No                     Yes

Improved Server-Side Rendering Memory Utilization

                                   No                     Yes

In addition to these new features, React 18 also includes a number of bug fixes and performance improvements.

Here is a more detailed look at some of the key features of React 18:

Concurrent Rendering: Concurrent rendering allows React to work on multiple tasks at the same time. This can improve performance by reducing the amount of time that React spends waiting for tasks to complete.
Automatic Batching: Automatic batching automatically groups together state updates that occur within a short period of time. This can reduce the number of re-renders that React needs to perform, which can also improve performance.
New Event Delegation Model: The new event delegation model reduces the number of event listeners that React needs to attach to the DOM. This can also improve performance.
New Context API: The new context API provides a more efficient way to manage context in React applications.
Experimental Suspense Hook: The experimental Suspense hook allows React to suspend rendering until certain conditions are met. This can be useful for improving the performance of applications that load data from a server.
Improved Server-Side Rendering Memory Utilization: React 18 improves the memory utilization of server-rendered applications. This can be beneficial for applications that need to render a large number of pages on the server.
